**Why a (real) example?**

1. **It's easy to understand**. As a developer, a real example is easy to relate to. It also provides a good basis to rely on when the developer would look to use the tool themselves.
1. **It's easy to create such a document**. If an example already exists in your codebase, there's no need to invent a new one. All you have to do is describe it.
1. **It helps you remember**. When you look at a concrete, real example - you see all the small implementation details. Not all of them are important to mention or explain, yet it makes sure you don't forget about those that are.
1. **It's maintainable**. By code coupling to an existing example, if something ever changes in the system and the example changes, your document will be updated. 
1. **It's easy to discover**. Thanks to the discoverability of Swimm documents, they are found when someone uses this tool. For example, when using a library for the first time, a developer may look for other usages of this library in the codebase, such as the wrapper function. Thanks to Swimm's IDE plugins, developers are likely to find the relevant document next to the wrapper function because it was referenced and code-coupled in the document.
