                    <p>
                        Smart Tokens are used to help you to write and edit docs that are interwoven with your codebase. 
                        By adding referenced code tokens (such as variables, functions, or class names) in your documentation, 
                        these live code references are tracked by Swimm to keep your documentation up to date. 
                        To add Smart Tokens in Swimm, type a Backtick <code>`</code> anywhere in the editor.

                        You can create a Playlist with documents that exist in one or more repositories. 
                        Simply navigate to another repo and select the docs you'd like to add. 
                        Note that Playlists can be embedded in other Playlists as well.

                        Data that is created with Swimm is synced exactly the same way you sync your code - via your code repository and Git. 
                        <br/> <br/> 
                        Remember that Swimm units are stored as Markdown files on your repo under the <code>./swm</code> folder. 
                        When you create or edit content, you commit it to your repository which can be reviewed, approved, 
                        and merged to a branch. It is shared when your teammates pull the latest version of the branch.
                        <br/> <br/> 
                        Swimm also has Cloud docs which are similar to common documentation tools. 
                        Cloud Docs are not coupled to your repository and can be shared via a link to any Swimm user.

                <p>
                    Many of our clients have documentation on several platforms when they install Swimm. <br/>
                    <strong>Your internal code-related documentation will get "superpowers"</strong> with Swimm compared to other documentation tools.
                    If you are already using a documentation tool, we highly recommended using Swimm's Batch Import feature to bring over all of your docs and other relevant files. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    If you decide to keep some of the documentation on other tools such as Notion or Confluence, 
                    the shortest and easiest way to incorporate them into Swimm is to link to them from within your docs or Playlists on Swimm. This is a useful way to curate the important parts of your documentation into subjects, and you can also link from other platforms to Swimm Documents or Playlists.
                    <br/><br/>
                    If there's a particular integration you would like to request, please let us know and contact us at info@swimm.io .

                    <p>
                        When creating code-coupled documentation, remember that you don't have to start from scratch. Swimm helps to the end with a bunch of options:
                        <ul>
                        <li>You can use <strong>Swimm's Guide Doc Creation</strong> wizard to walk you through step-by-step to create a doc on any topic you'd like. We ask a series of questions and help you structure the document and understand which parts of the code you need to choose in order to explain it.
                        </li>

                        <li>Start creating documentation from a pull request. If there's a pull request that you just finished or one that is a good example of how to solve something specific we bring in all the important "Difs" as code snippets, and you can start documenting from there.
                        </li>

                        <li>Create documentation using Swimm Templates
                        </li>

                        <li>Import existing documentation, including Markdown files. You can also perform a batch import from an entire repository or a local folder that contains Markdown files.
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
            },

                title: "How much of developer time in sprints should be reserved for Swimm?",
                content:
                    <p>
                        You don't have to reserve developers' time for Swimm, and you can create documentation when needed. 
                        However, we have seen teams successfully reserve 1 hour in the beginning of every sprint to document the main outcomes of the previous sprint.
                        <br/><br/>
                        That said, to see immediate value from Swimm, it really takes a very short time - even just minutes.
                        We recommend the following:
                        <br/><br/>
                        <h4>Step 1:</h4>
                        Find areas in the code that are common for new developers to start with. Some examples:
                        <ul>
                        <li>How to set up a new environment</li>
                        <li>How to create a common component</li>
                        <li>An overview of a system or a process</li>
                        </ul>
                        Swimm has several templates to start with to write effective documentation.
                        <br/><br/>
                        <h4>Step 2:</h4>
                        Make sure all team members install Swimm's IDE plugin.  When your documentation appears naturally inside the IDE, it encourages your team to read it in context. What we know is that the key for investing in documentation is making sure people will find it easily when they need it the most.

                        Swimm helps you create code-coupled documentation very quickly. 
                        <br/>
                        To get started consider the following method:
                        <br/><br/>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Create a new document</li>
                        <li>Add code snippets related to the topic</li>
                        <li>In a sentence or two, describe what each snippet does</li>
                        <li>Fill in the space between snippets by describing how they interconnect</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br/>
                        With some practice, it can take just several minutes to create documentation to help your larger 
                        team understand aspects of the codebase that will benefit from the documentation.

                <p>
                    Swimm allows you to create <a target="_blank" href="/features">code coupled documentation</a> by adding live snippets from your code. 
                    Regular documentation systems are not built for software documentation because code changes rapidly and regular documentation solutions need to be manually maintained.

                    <br/><strong>With Swimm, it becomes easily manageable thanks to Swimm's Auto-sync algorithm that helps users keep these snippets and your documentation always up to date. </strong>
                    <br/><br/>
                    Coupling documentation with the code also means it's more <strong>focused and</strong> <strong>easy to find</strong> while you're working - having your documentation available directly in your IDE where you need it.
                    Code-coupled documentation also gives you new powerful ways to document your architecture, your classes, and your styling guides (and so on) in ways that weren't possible before. 
                    <br/><strong>With Swimm's platform you get far better internal documentation with much less time invested</strong>.

                content:
                <p>
                    Comments help us understand the specific lines of code they are associated with. Understanding code, and especially complex code scenarios, usually require following a flow of code from different files and sometimes different repos. So comments do not help with that. 
                    <br/><br/>But also, if you forget to update a comment, you don't get a notification or warning to make an update. With Swimm's patented Auto-sync feature, we ensure that your documentation stays synced with the code as the code changes.
So Swimm doesn't replace comments in code - <a target="_blank" href="https://swimm.io/blog/walkthrough-documentation-where-swimms-main-value-lies/">it augments them</a>. It puts the narrative right where you need to find it, <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.swimm.io/ide-integrations/ide-plugins">in your IDE</a>. You'll see that it's there for your team if they need it when they need it.

                <p>
                    Swimm is a crossbreed between code comments and high-level documentation. With Swimm, you add code snippets to your docs so they are available right inside the doc whenever you select a code snippet. When you use one of <a target="_blank" href="https://swimm.io/blog/ide-integrated-documentation-using-swimm/">Swimm’s IDE plugins</a>, links to available documentation appear right within the code.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Because documentation is code-coupled, you find your documents in time, they describe flow and patterns using the actual code, documentation coverage is automatically detected and flagged, and there’s no more risk of code comments becoming outdated or accidentally deleted.

These all are, unfortunately, very familiar problems for most organizations.

                <p>
                    <code>Pseudo code</code> snippets (codeblocks) are fundamentally different from Swimm snippets by their function and purpose.
                    <ul>
                    <li>Codeblocks are used for demonstrating an example or usage of the code. <br/>The example itself doesn't exist in the codebase and its purpose is to explain how things work. Codeblocks are not synced or automatically maintained by Swimm.</li>
                    <li>Swimm's code snippets are actual line-by-line code taken directly from the codebase. Snippets are synced and automatically maintained and updated by Swimm.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong>There is a way to have example code that is also synced or maintained. Here's how:
                    code examples are often very similar to tests. Traditionally tests are a way to implement a part of the code. You can add a test about a component, a function, or a class.                    When you add a test that represents your example and then add it as a Swimm snippet, you'll have synced code examples in your docs.

                    <p>
                        Swimm does not store your documents or parts of your code. However, 
                        GitHub authoring policy doesn't allow write permissions per directory, 
                        so Swimm needs organizational, read & write permissions to the designated 
                        documentation folder in your repository (a <i>"./swm"</i> folder we create in order to store the documents).
                        <br /><br />
                        More about the 3 types of permissions:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Organizational permission:</strong> You'll need to specify which organization owns the repos you'll be working on. This will allow you to grant Swimm individual repo permissions within that organization.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Read permission:</strong> Swimm will need to be able to read your repository and access to the entire commit history in order to be able to understand and account for code changes. Note that your code remains in your repo, and Swimm simply stores metadata about snippets, paths, and tokens so that it can remember what it's supposed to keep track of.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Write permission:</strong> Swimm uses a special directory named .swm/ in your repo to store your documentation along with a unique identifier that correlates your documentation to your repository.
                            </li>

                        <br/><br/>

                        <li>Allowing Swimm to automatically update and commit minor, out-of-sync code snippet inconsistencies in your docs.</li>
                        <li>Allowing Swimm to fail a check only when outdated/out-of-sync docs are caused by changes performed in the current PR by the developer, instead of changes that may have been performed in previous PRs by other developers.</li>
                        <li>Allowing Swimm to alert you via a PR comment recommending you existing Swimm documentation that you should review when code changes.</li>
                        <li>Receiving an email whenever a new doc was merged to the default branch. </li>

                <p>
                    Swimm IDE plugins for VS Code and the Jetbrains Suite are available in the Microsoft / Jetbrains marketplace. The current versions of the plugins are for read only documentation.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Swimm is currently working on a release to create documentation from the IDE. The release is planned in the coming months. If you want to know more exact roadmap details, please reach out to us on our <a target="_blank" href="https://swimm.io/slack">Community Slack Channel</a>.

                    <p>
                        Swimm is language agnostic and supports all languages. Our continuous integration tools work on all Git hosting platforms and Swimm's GitHub App.
                        <br/>
                        Swimm relies on Git, but currently does not support other version control systems (VCSs) other than Git (such as Mercurial, Perforce, etc).

                        Yes there is! <br/>
                        Notion enables exporting all of your spaces to markdown files. Then, you can use Import them quickly as swimm docs.
                        In order tor add a Swimm permalink to a Notion Doc. More integrations and embedding support is on our roadmap.

                content: 
                    <p>
                        Unlike Notion and Confluence, Swimm is built with developers and their workflow as our main focus. 
                        Our editor is optimized for code documentation. We keep documentation up to date with every PR and we make docs easily accessible in the IDE or Github. This drives our clients to replace Notion or Confluence with Swimm as their main documentation hub.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Some of our clients still use Notion or Confluence in parallel. This mostly happens when non-R&D departments are heavy users of these platforms, or when there's a longer transition period to Swimm, instead of a one-time migration.
                        <br/><br/>
                        To work with Swimm and one of these platforms, you can use deep links, or a script to import Swimm's .md documents into Notion or Confluence. We are currently working on more tools that will enable better integration with Confluence and Notion as well. Stay tuned.

                        Swimm uses keyboard shortcuts when editing a doc. <br/>
                        When you are editing a doc, go to the Swimm Help Center and click <strong>Keyboard Shortcuts</strong>.
