The [FAQ](https://docs.swimm.io/faq) is a static MDX page that uses React components with simple markdown. The headings are generated as HTML when the site is compiled, which is what powers the right-side table of contents. The sections themselves are generated by the `ðŸ“„ src/components/FrequentQuestions.js` component, which is a wrapper for the [react-faq](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-faq-component) component. The styles for the page come from Docusaurus, the styles for the collapsable FAQ entries are found in `ðŸ“„ src/components/FrequentQuestions.module.css`

<br/>

Below is how the page is generated. We let Docusaurus control the headings and then render the entries in the client. `FrequentQuestions`<swm-token data-swm-token=":docs/faq.mdx:39:1:1:`&lt;FrequentQuestions Category=&quot;Creating&quot; /&gt;`"/> is the component that is called with the argument that correlates to an index in the `FAQIndex`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/components/FrequentQuestions.js:13:2:2:`const FAQIndex = {`"/> object.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ docs/faq.mdx
```mdx
ðŸŸ© 20     ## ðŸªª Signing Up & Permission Scope
ðŸŸ© 21     
ðŸŸ© 22     Additional information about Swimm's security profile can be found <a href="/security/">here</a>
ðŸŸ© 23     
ðŸŸ© 24     <FrequentQuestions Category="SignUpAndPermissions" />
```

<br/>

This is what actually wraps the FAQ component and injects our entries. Notice that **there is no type checking or default category** (TODO: Fix that, I just needed something that works).
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ src/components/FrequentQuestions.js
```javascript
â¬œ 609        }
â¬œ 610    };
â¬œ 611    
ðŸŸ© 612    export default function FrequentQuestions({Category, Index=FAQIndex}) {
ðŸŸ© 613        var data = Index[Category];
ðŸŸ© 614        return (
ðŸŸ© 615        <div>
ðŸŸ© 616                <Faq
ðŸŸ© 617                    data={data}
ðŸŸ© 618                    styles={styles}
ðŸŸ© 619                    config={config}
ðŸŸ© 620                />
ðŸŸ© 621                <br />
ðŸŸ© 622            </div>
ðŸŸ© 623        );
ðŸŸ© 624    }
```

<br/>

And this is an example entry. Each part of the page corresponds to an index in this object. Note that the first-level `title`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/components/FrequentQuestions.js:15:1:1:`        title: &quot;&quot;,`"/> is intentionally left empty, this is because we want Docusaurus generating the headings along with the automatic table of contents, not the component.

Each row is then defined in order. To add another section:

*   add the heading and call to `FrequentQuestions`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/components/FrequentQuestions.js:612:6:6:`export default function FrequentQuestions({Category, Index=FAQIndex}) {`"/> matching the other sections in `ðŸ“„ docs/faq.mdx`
    
*   create an index for it in `FAQIndex`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/components/FrequentQuestions.js:13:2:2:`const FAQIndex = {`"/>

### ðŸ“„ src/components/FrequentQuestions.js
```javascript
ðŸŸ© 13     const FAQIndex = {
ðŸŸ© 14         Creating: {
ðŸŸ© 15             title: "",
ðŸŸ© 16             rows: [
ðŸŸ© 17                 {
ðŸŸ© 18                     title: "What are Smart Tokens and how do they work?",
ðŸŸ© 19                     content:
ðŸŸ© 20                         <p>
ðŸŸ© 21                             Smart Tokens are used to help you to write and edit docs that are interwoven with your codebase. 
ðŸŸ© 22                             By adding referenced code tokens (such as variables, functions, or class names) in your documentation, 
ðŸŸ© 23                             these live code references are tracked by Swimm to keep your documentation up to date. 
ðŸŸ© 24                             To add Smart Tokens in Swimm, type a Backtick <code>`</code> anywhere in the editor. 
ðŸŸ© 25                             Read more about Smart Tokens <a target="_blank" href="/Features/editor-commands#smart-tokens">here.</a> 
ðŸŸ© 26                         </p>
ðŸŸ© 27                 },
```

<br/>

That's it! You can do all of this while the dev environment is running and see it load on the screen as soon as you save the files.
