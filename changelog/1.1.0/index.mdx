# Swimm 1.1.0 has been released!

We're pleased to announce the availability of **Swimm 1.1.0**<SwimmMoji text="release"/>

## New Features:
- **Demo repo** - Users can experiment with Swimm in a new workspace without connecting a repo.
- **GitHub App links to added docs** - when adding a document to an existing PR, Swimm leaves a comment with links to the added document so that reviewers can quickly access them.

## Improvements:
- **Branch selector view** - the branches you have most recently worked on will be listed first. 
- **Changing branches from the View Doc page** - You can now change branches while viewing a document.
- **Snippet selection** - You can now better distinguish between snippets already added to the doc and snippets currently selected.

## Bug fixes
- Fixed: when reviewing an out-of-date doc from GitHub, committing changes takes you back to the pull request. 

For further information and any questions, please reach out to us on our <SwimmLink target="slack" />.
