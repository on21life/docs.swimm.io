# Diagrams and charts

You can add diagrams and charts to your documentation in Swimm, using Mermaid Syntax in the editor.

To get started, type `/Diagram` to start editing your mermaid diagram.

You can embed Smart Tokens and paths to your diagrams, so they stay up to date as the code evolves 🤯

You can see Mermaid and Swimm in action here:
