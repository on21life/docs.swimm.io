# Diagrams and charts

You can add diagrams and charts to your documentation in Swimm, using [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) Syntax in the editor.

To get started, type `/Diagram` to start editing your Mermaid diagram.

## Mermaid + Swimm = up-to-date Diagrams ðŸ¤¯

You can now create and edit Mermaid diagrams straight from Swimmâ€™s editor:

The real value comes when creating diagrams with Swimmâ€™s [Smart Tokens](https://docs.swimm.io/Features/editor-commands#add-smart-tokens). Type a backtick (\`) within your diagram labels to code-couple constants or variables and you won't need to worry about the impact of refactoring on your documentation, as well as renaming those values referenced in your diagram. This means - diagrams that are up to date with your code ðŸ¤¯
