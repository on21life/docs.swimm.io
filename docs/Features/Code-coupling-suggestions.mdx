As you edit your docs, you will likely mention some references to parts of the code and Swimm offers auto-detection and suggestions for these code references.

For example:

“How to add a new LoggingComponent in our app”

In this example, `LoggingComponent` is a reference to a class in the code. Swimm's general recommendation for maintaining up to date documents is to include important code references in the documentation.

With Swimm’s automatic detection, it is even more fun and easy. In the example above, Swimm is likely to detect that `LoggingComponent` is a code reference and will notify you as you type.

**Here’s a quick look at how code coupling suggestions work.**
