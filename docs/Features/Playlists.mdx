# Swimm Playlists

A Swimm Playlist is just what it sounds like: a collection of documents, links, videos, Markdown files, and images stored as a Playlist collection in a particular order. They can be shared with anyone who has access to the repo, and changes are tracked with Git, with all the benefits of commits and branches.

### **Common usages of Playlists are:**

- An onboarding program for an individual or a role.
- A topic that needs to be consumed as a collection.

## **How to create & edit Playlists​**

To create a Playlist, first, go into your repo, and click on `Create`. Then choose Playlist.

On the left hand side, click "Add docs, links or other Playlists", and choose the elements you would like to incorporate within your Playlist.

Note that you can also create new documentation for your Playlists while inside an existing Playlist.

## **How to review Playlists​**

Open a Swimm Playlist and you’ll see that at the bottom of every page, there’s an option to mark it as read. You can begin reviewing a Playlist and stop at any point. Swimm will always keep track of where you’ve left off.
