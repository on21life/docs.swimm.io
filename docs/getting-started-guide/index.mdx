Choose how youâ€™d like to get started:

## 1. Use our demo repo

With our <Link to="/getting-started-guide/demo-repo">demo repo</Link> you can create a document with snippets and smart tokens, and even play around with our <Link to="/Features/keeping-docs-up-to-date">Auto-sync</Link> feature. It is a great way to get to know Swimm without connecting your own repository.
