Choose your way to get started:

# 1. Use our demo repo
With our <Link to="/new-to-swimm/demo-repo">demo repo</Link> you can create a document with snippets and smart tokens, and even play around with our <Link to="/Features/keeping-docs-up-to-date">Auto-sync</Link> feature. It is a great way to get to know Swimm without connecting your own repository.

<Link to="/getting-started-guide/demo-repo">Start with Swimm's demo repo</Link>.

# 2. Use your own repo
Start directly with your own repository.

<Link to="/getting-started-guide/first-doc">Start with your own repo</Link>.
