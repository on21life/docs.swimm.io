# Troubleshooting

**Why do I need to register to Swimm?**<br/>
In order to start using Swimm, you will need a Swimm account with at least one workspace. Note that your repositories need to be associated with a workspace, and Swimm stores minimal metadata about your repositories.

## Troubleshooting and Error messages:

Errors you may encounter, after logging in.<br/>

:::caution
Login error **“Swimm repository not detected”**<br/>
Meaning: The repository doesn’t have any Swimm Docs and has never been connected to your Swimm workspace.<br/>
:::


Or<br/>
:::caution
Login error **“Cannot retrieve the workspace or repo information”**<br/>
Or **“You are not a member of a workspace where \[repo name\] is connected to.”**<br/>
Meaning: The repository is not connected to a Swimm workspace or you are not a member of a workspace where this repository is connected to.<br/>
:::

**In case of all the errors listed above, make sure that:**

1.  **Your organization is registered and has a Swimm workspace.**
    
    If not, create one - it’s free.
    
2.  **You are a member of that workspace.**
    
    If not, request from your administrator to join the workspace.
    
3.  **The repository you are working on has been added to the workspace.**
    
    If not, login to the workspace and “add a repo” to your workspace.
    
4.  **You have editing GitHub permissions to that repository.**
    
    If not, ask your administrator to give you editing permissions.
    
5.  **You are logged in to Swimm in the IDE.**

## You are logged in, but cannot see any documents
VS Code requires that the repository is launched from its root directory to function correctly.

This means that if the repository is located at:
`/users/desktop/repo-name`

And you launched VS Code from `/users/desktop`, for example - Swimm may not be able to find the documents.

**Workaround**: Open the repository's root folder from VS Code.

## When you try to log in, the browser opens and nothing happens

This may happen in some setups, for example when you run VSCode in Ubuntu and configure a specific browser to be the default one for VS Code.

**Workaround**: Copy the callback URL and paste it into your browser (the one you use for surfing the web).
    

## Supported scenarios

**Single repo**

*   Opening a single repo from your IDE is the most straightforward way.
    

**Sibling multi-repo**

*   Opening a folder with multiple same-level repositories. This is also supported by Swimm. Swimm’s welcome panel will detect the active repo and all the information will be relative to it.
    

**Nested repositories**

*   Nested repositories (such as Git submodules) are not a supported pattern.
