## Step 1: Install

Get your Visual Studio Code extension <Link href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Swimm.swimm">here</Link>.<br/>

Once installed, you will see Swimm's icon in your IDE in the ‚ÄúActivity Bar‚Äù on the left.

Click it, and **login** if you already have an account. If not, **register** - it's completely free and takes just a couple of minutes.

## Register

When you register, you will go through an onboarding wizard that will require you to do two things:

1.  Create a workspace
2.  Connect a repository

After that, you will need to log inüëá

## Login

Clicking the login button will redirect you to a browser. This is a standard login mechanism for IDE extensions.
