# Troubleshooting

**Why do I need to register to Swimm?**<br/>
In order to start using Swimm, you will need a Swimm account with at least one workspace. Note that your repositories need to be associated with a workspace, and Swimm stores minimal metadata about your repositories.

## Troubleshooting and Error messages:

Errors you may encounter, after logging in.<br/>

:::caution
Login error **“Swimm repository not detected”**<br/>
Meaning: The repository doesn’t have any Swimm Docs and has never been connected to your Swimm workspace.<br/>
:::

Or<br/>
:::caution
Login error **“Cannot retrieve the workspace or repo information”**<br/>
Or **“You are not a member of a workspace where \[repo name\] is connected to.”**<br/>
Meaning: The repository is not connected to a Swimm workspace or you are not a member of a workspace where this repository is connected to.<br/>
:::

**In case of all the errors listed above, make sure that:**

1.  **Your organization is registered and has a Swimm workspace.**

    If not, create one - it’s free.

2.  **You are a member of that workspace.**

    If not, request from your administrator to join the workspace.

3.  **The repository you are working on has been added to the workspace.**

    If not, login to the workspace and “add a repo” to your workspace.

4.  **You have editing GitHub permissions to that repository.**

    If not, ask your administrator to give you editing permissions.

5.  **You are logged in to Swimm in the IDE.**

## In case you are using Android Studio

Follow these steps:

1. Start the IDE, use `Help` -> `Find Action`, type "Choose Boot Java Runtime for the IDE", and press `Enter`.
2. Select the newest version **with JCEF** to install.
3. Click the `OK` button and wait until the file with JetBrains Runtime is downloaded and configured.
4. Restart the IDE.


## Supported scenarios

**Single repo**

- Opening a single repo from your IDE is the most straightforward way.

**Sibling multi-repo**

- Opening a folder with multiple same-level repositories. This is also supported by Swimm. Swimm’s welcome panel will detect the active repo and all the information will be relative to it.

**Nested repositories**

- Nested repositories (such as Git submodules) are not a supported pattern.
