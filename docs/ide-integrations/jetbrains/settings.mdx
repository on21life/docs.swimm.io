# Setting up

## Step 1: Install

Get your JetBrains plugin <Link href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20716-swimm">here</Link>.<br/>

Once installed, you will see Swimm's panel in your IDE.<br/>

**Log in** if you already have an account. If not, **register** - it's completely free and takes just a couple of minutes.

## Register

When you register, you will go through an onboarding wizard that will require you to do two things:

1.  Create a workspace
2.  Connect a repository

After that, you will need to log inðŸ‘‡

## Login

Clicking the login button will redirect you to a browser. This is a standard login mechanism for IDE plugins.
