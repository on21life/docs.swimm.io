DaC (Documentation as Code) is an approach of treating documentation like code so that documentation and code are created and maintained together.

**Docs as Code principles include the following:**

- Docs are part of the Version Control (Git).
- The underlying syntax is Markdown.
- Docs can be the subject of code reviews, automated tests, and the CI process.

The Docs as code approach gives developers the benefits of a more streamlined process.

## Docs as Code & Swimm

Swimm saves all documentation as code, which means that Swimm Docs are as easy to read as Markdown files.

A simple and typical editing workflow looks like this:

1.  A developer commits changes.
2.  Swimm detects that as a result of code changes, some documents need to be amended and notifies the developer.
3.  The developer then accesses these docs and either automatically approves Swimmâ€™s Auto-sync corrections, or decides to further edit the doc.
4.  Once done, developers commit the changes as part of the PR.
