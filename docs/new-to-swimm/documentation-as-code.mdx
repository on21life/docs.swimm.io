DaC (Documentation as Code) is an approach of treating documentation like code so that documentation and code are created and maintained together.

**Docs as Code principles include the following:**

*   Docs are part of the Version Control (Git).
    
*   The underlying syntax is Markdown.
    
*   Docs can be the subject of code reviews, automated tests, and the CI process.
    

The Docs-as-code approach gives developers the benefits of a more streamlined process.

## Docs as Code & Swimm

Swimm saves all documentation as code, which means that Swimm Docs are as easy to read as Markdown files.

A simple and typical editing workflow looks like this:

1.  A developer commits their changes.
    
2.  Swimm detects that as a result of code changes, some documents need to be amended and notifies the developer.
    
3.  The developer then accesses these docs and either automatically approves Swimm’s Auto-sync corrections, or decides to further edit the doc.
    
4.  Once done, developers commit the changes as part of the PR.

This document is automatically kept up-to-date using [Swimm](https://swimm.io).
