# What permissions are required?

Swimm require three types of permissions: organizational, read, and write permissions.<br/>

:::tip We never store your code on our servers<br/>
We have a special [privacy and security FAQ](https://docs.swimm.io/security) that answers many questions about how things are stored and transmitted. Your code and snippets aren't stored on our servers; Swimm just needs permission to read files, analyze changes, and write the content you create to the `.swm/` directory.<br/>
:::

## Organizational permissions

Since most repository hosting services are tied to your _personal_ log-in, you'll need to tell Swimm specifically which organization owns the repos you'll be working on. This will allow you to grant Swimm individual repo permissions within that organization.

## Read permissions

In order to be able to select code snippets within the **Snippet Studio**, Swimm will need to be able to read the repository.

Swimm also needs access to the entire commit history in order to be able to understand and account for code changes. This is what enables **Swimm's Auto-sync algorithm** to automatically process changes to your code, automatically syncing **Smart Paths & Smart Tokens**. Your code remains in your repo, and Swimm simply stores metadata about snippets, paths and tokens so that it can remember what it's supposed to keep track of.

## Write permissions

Swimm uses a special directory named `.swm/` in your repo to store your documentation along with a unique identifier that correlates your documentation to your repository.

Swimm needs to be able to write when you create or update a document, and when it detects changes that can be automatically synchronized.

Upon user's request, Swimm will also dynamically create branches and open pull requests as needed when it encounters protected branches.
