# Members and Admins

Within a specific Swimm workspace, there are currently two types of users at Swimm: Members and Admins

**Members can**: Create, edit, collaborate, and assign documentation, Playlists & diagrams, and connect to the Slack app.

Notice that most of the access control is done via Git - if a user can access a specific repository, they can also access the documentation on that repository.

**Admins have all the capabilities of Members plus the following. They can:**

1.  Connect repositories to the workspace.

2.  Install Swimm's GitHub App to automate workflows to promote documentation creation and consumption.

3.  Invite additional Members to the workspace.

4.  Promote other Members to Admins.
