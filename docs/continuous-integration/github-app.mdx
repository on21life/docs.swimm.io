# Swimm's GitHub App

If you're using GitHub, Swimm’s GitHub App will help you streamline PRs to verify that your documentation is up to date.

To get the Swimm GitHub App, you first need to <Link href="https://app.swimm.io/register">sign up for Swimm</Link>. You should use Swimm’s Web App to create documentation and configure the setting for our GitHub App.

# Getting the GitHub app

Once you are set up with your workspace and have connected a repository, go to <Link href="https://github.com/apps/swimm-io"> GitHub</Link> and install the app on your repository.

## Swimm's GitHub App features

### Accepting Auto-synced changes from GitHub

Swimm’s patented <Link href="https://swimm.io/blog/how-does-swimm-s-auto-sync-feature-work/">Auto-sync</Link> algorithm analyzes what happens in your codebase. When Swimm Verify check recognizes Auto-sync documentation changes, you’ll be notified via a comment on your pull request.

In case some changes to the relevant files are marked as "Auto-synced" by the algorithm (that is, no human interaction is required), you can ask the GitHub app to trigger a commit that accepts Auto-sync's suggestions. To do so, click the “Approve Auto-sync” button in the Check, which accepts all Auto-synced docs from the GitHub App.

### Automatic Auto-sync approval

Set up automatic Auto-sync approval in the GitHub App settings to automatically accept Auto-sync changes and commit them to your open pull request in a dedicated commit.

Go to GitHub App Settings and check the “Configure Automatic Auto-sync Approval” box.

### New doc notifications

Set an alert on Slack or via email whenever a new document is created and merged to your main branch. This helps keep track of new documentation in your repo and allows you to invite other members of your organization to read and learn more about new documentation. We’ve found that this encourages a better overall understanding of the codebase.

Go to GitHub App Settings and add the requested email under "Email me when new docs are created."

### Draft documents from pull requests

When a pull request is interesting enough to document, Swimm’s GitHub App analyzes code changes and notifies you with a comment to create documentation.

To create a doc, click the **Review draft in app** button in our comment and go to Swimm’s Web App. All the code changes from your PR will be added to a document and then you’ll just need to explain the code.

### Doc recommendations

Swimm’s GitHub App alerts you to relevant docs on PRs, recommending documentation to review when code changes.

### Swimm Verify Check on PR changes only

Swimm’s GitHub App has the option to run Swimm Verify only on files that are changed in this specific PR.

- When this option is disabled (this is the default setting), Swimm will show updates related to any outdated/out-of-sync docs.
- When the setting under `Configure Swimm Verify Check` is enabled from the GitHub App setting, it will notify you only when the changes in your PR have impacted Swimm docs.

<br />

When there are issues on your main branch, consider turning this option on until they are resolved. This feature will allow other engineers to avoid unnecessary delays while you can fix the broken document.

### Disabling comments

Swimm’s GitHub App has an option to disable comments to reduce the number of notifications that you’re sent.

If you don’t want to see Swimm Recommended Doc comments, you can disable it in the settings. And if you’d prefer not to get updates on your PRs when your documentation is outdated, you can set that preference in the settings as well.

### Integrations with other tools

Swimm is partnered with <Link href="https://docs.swimm.io/continuous-integration/swimm-atlassian-compass-application/">Atlassian Compass.</Link> Use Swimm’s Compass Integration to link Swimm documentation to the Compass component and see the latest documentation status for all your distributed services from a single place.

Additional integrations are on the way.
